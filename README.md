# StatsYard

StatsYard is an exploratory Elixir project that aims to delve into the capabilities of Elixir, OTP, and the BEAM virtual machine. The goal of this project is to learn as we go, and eventually build up a simple but functional time series database that one can ship metrics and query them back out.

The process of building this out is documented in a series of blog posts, and all commits (other than README updates) will be present in branches that are named according to the blog post in which the changes were discussed. Please feel free to follow along, beginning with [Let's Build Something: Elixir, Part 1 - A Simple GenServer](http://tech.strofcon.org/2016/03/lets-build-elixir-part-1.html)!

Happy hacking!
